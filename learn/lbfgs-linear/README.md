Linear and Logistic Regression
====
* input format: LibSVM
* Local Example: [run-linear.sh](run-linear.sh)
* Runnig on YARN: [run-yarn.sh](run-yarn.sh)

Multi-Threading Optimization
====
* The code can be  multi-threaded, we encourage you to use it
  - Simply add ```nthread=k``` where k is the number of threads you want to use
* If you submit with YARN 
  - Use ```--vcores``` and ```-mem``` to request CPU and memory resources
  - Some scheduler in YARN do not honor CPU request, you can request more memory to grab working slots
* Usually multi-threading improves speed in general
  - You can use less workers and assign more resources to each of worker
  - This usually means less communication overhead and faster running time

Parameters
====
All the parameters can be set by param=value
