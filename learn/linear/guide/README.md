# Tutorial to run linear method

`wormhole/linear` solves the following linear method
```tex
min_w sum_i loss(y_i, <w, x_i>) + penalty(w)
```
where `(x_i, y_i)` is a data pair and vector `w` is the model we will
learn.

## Build & Run

Use [build.sh](../build.sh) to build, and
[demo_local.sh](demo_local.sh) to train on the sample dataset in local machine, or
[demo_yarn.sh](demo_yarn.sh) to run the job on Yarn.
